  * src/sdf2sig.sdf: Handle aliases in SDF by
  removing them before creating constructors.

Old TODOs
  
  * Fill-out the package description in desciption.pkg
  
  * stratego-imports contains a copy of the module get-modules.r. This module
    also lives in the sdf-tools package where it is used by sdf-imports. This
    code duplication should be removed
