Two tools for the generation of Stratego code from Sdf grammars:

  * sdf2sig
    Generate Stratego signatures from Sdf grammars.

  * sdf2stratego
    Generate not only signatures, but also overlays.

Actually, both these tools accept not just ordinary Sdf, but Sdf which
may contain Stratego sections. These sections are passed through to the
generated Stratego modules.

To obtain just the Sdf parts of the mixed format the following tool is
provided:

  * rsdf2sdf
    Filter out Stratego sections from Sdf+Stratego definitions.
