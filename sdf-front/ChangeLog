	* syn/version-2.1/*: renamed the embedding of SDF 2.1 in Stratego
	to Stratego-Sdf2-Syntax because SDF syntax definition has the same
	name and I want to use Stratego-Sdf2 for the new syntax
	definition. All .meta files have been changed.

	* syn/version-pgen-2.0: now pack-sdf has been updated we can pack
	the sdf definition in ourselves. The modules have been unpacked
	and added to SVN. Todo: pack the modules from the ASF library and
	include the ASF library in the sdf2-bundle.

	* syn/version-pgen-2.0/embeddings/stratego:embedding of the new
	SDF syntax in Stratego.

	* parse/pack-sdf.str: moved from sdf-tools to sdf-front.

	* sig/version-2.1: moved old signatures to subdirectory for the
	old version of sdf.

	* sig/version-pgen-2.0/Sdf.str: Stratego signature voor SDF2 as it
	appears in pgen 2.0. This signature has been generated using
	sdf2rtg and rtg2sig of stratego-regular since sdf2sig cannot
	handle these syntax definitions. The signature is not generated in
	the build process because stratego-regular is not yet in
	StrategoXT.

	* xtc/sdf-options.str: moved common sdf related command line
	options and utils from stratego-regular to sdf-front.

	* pp/Sdf2.pp: improved the pretty printing of renamings using
	those sexy A/R boxes. Result:
	
        module JavaRenamed
        imports Java
                  [ PackageImportDec     => JavaPackageImportDec
                    TypeImportDec        => JavaTypeImportDec
                    ImportDec            => JavaImportDec
                    PackageDec           => JavaPackageDec
                    CompilationUnit      => JavaCompilationUnit
                    TypeDec              => JavaTypeDec
	            ....

	* syn/version-2.1/Module-Sdf-Syntax.sdf: missing constructor for
	the renamed import module.

	* pp/Sdf2.pp: many missing pretty print rules for renamed modules.

	* syn/*: added the pgen 2.0 syntax definition for SDF as the first
	step into upgrading to the most recent sdf version. sdf-front now
	contains two versions of SDF2. The old one is still called
	Sdf2-Syntax. The new one is Sdf2.

	* syn/Renaming-Sdf-Syntax.sdf: renaming productions now have
	constructors.  Constructor names copied from the v2.4 grammar at:
	http://homepages.cwi.nl/~mdejonge/grammar-base/sdf.2.4/sdf.2.4-V.def

	* syn/Stratego-Sdf2.sdf: added quotation and anti-quotation for
	aliases and renamings.

2003-05-27  Martin Bravenboer  <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* parse/sdf-ensugar.str and desugar.str: added (de)sugaring of
	no-attrs to attrs([]).

	* syn/Stratego-Sdf2.sdf: added variables for symbols, attributes
	and productions. Quotations for Grammar and Attributes.

2003-05-26  Martin Bravenboer  <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* Added quotation and anti-quotation of symbols to Stratego-Sdf2

	* Added initial sdf-ensugar.

	* Added initial sdf-desugar. What is sugar? What is normalization?

	* Added initial Sdf2 in Stratego syntax definition. Useful for
	generation of Sdf2 and unit-testing of sdf-tools.

	* Creation of sdf-front. This is a collection of material from
	sdf-tools that hasn't yet been distributed.
