	* bootstrap: Added WANT_AUTOMAKE and WANT_AUTOCONF to make bootstrap
	more compatible with Gentoo, Mandrake, etc.

	* xtc/xtar.str: added generation of ,pp, pp.af (renamed to app:
	single file extension works much better) .rtg, .rtgnf (no dash),
	.str, and .rtree. The basic xtar functionality is now complete!

        Maybe we should include and use some meta information by
        default, instead of mining the contents of an xtar.

	* xtc/xtar.str: Implemented very basic version of xtar. It creates
	an SDF definition, and SGLR parse table and stores them in a zip
	archive by invoking the command-line zip tool.
