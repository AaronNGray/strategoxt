.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBsglr\fR
is a scannerless, generalized LR parser. It interprets a parse table on a given textual input file. The parse table must be generated from an SDF2 grammar definition using the
\fBsdf2table\fR
tool. If the result of the parse is unambiguous, a parse tree is emitted. In the case of an ambiguity, a parse forest is emitted.
.PP
The term "scannerless" refers to the fact that the parser treats characters as tokens. There is no separate token scanner. The term "generalized" indicates that the parser finds all possible derivations for a given input string. Together, these two features allows users to construct ambiguous grammars, if they desire.
\fBsglr\fR
will not complain about conflicts in the parse table, but output the ambiguous result.
.PP
For the ambiguous cases, the user is free to construct problem\-specific disambiguation tools which must be applied to the output from
\fBsglr\fR. This is useful for dealing with various complicated programming languages that are highly ambiguous and context\-sensitive.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fBInput/Output Options\fR
.TP
\fB\-i \fR\fB\fIfile\fR\fR
The input file is given by the file name

.SH "EXAMPLE"
.PP
Assuming you have used
\fBsdf2table\fR
to generate a parse table for you language in the file
\fIlang.tbl\fR, and that your input program is in the file
\fIinput.lang\fR, you can apply
\fBsglr\fR
as follows:
.sp
.nf
$ sglr \-p lang.tbl \-i input.lang \-o lang.trm
.fi
.PP
The resulting parse tree (or possibly parse forest, if your language grammar allows ambiguities) will be in
\fIlang.trm\fR.
