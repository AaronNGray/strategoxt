	* Release 0.7 (fix2)

2002-03-10  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* Release 0.7

2002-03-08  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* Release 0.7beta3

	* src/stratego.c: Only add annotations after traversing a term
	when the original term had annotations; ATsetAnnotations is only
	defined if the annotations argument is a proper term.

2002-03-07  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* src/aterm-extension.c (ATmap): Explicitly order evaluation of
	arguments to ensure that application to head element is done
	before tail of the list. Apparently argument evaluation is
	compiler/platform dependent in C.

2002-02-12  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* src/stratego.c: Extended the traversal operators to preserve
	annotations.

2002-01-26  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* src/stratego.c (_bagof): Replaced call to fail() by call to
	_fail(t), which is the srts interface function for failure.

2002-01-25  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* src/Makefile.am (libstratego_a_SOURCES): Declared
	stratego-choice.h as a built source to force building it.

2002-01-15  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* src/: Adapted the Stratego Run-Time System to (conditionally)
	include the Nancy Choice Point Library. This provides an
	alternative implementation for choice from the current
	one---although it comes down to the same thing, i.e., setjmp and
	longjmp. The advantage of this addition is that it enables global
	choice. For programs only using local choice this extension is
	transparent. By choosing the --with-cpl switch of srts/configure
	the choice point library will be used. By default the old
	implementation is used. For programs using the new ++ and <++
	operators the --with-cpl flag should be used.

	* Release 0.7beta

2002-01-06  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* src/stratego.c: Special handling of lists in generic traversal
	operators required by support for native ATerm lists.

	* src/aterm-extension.c (AThasName): Commented out functions
	converting to and from cons/nil lists

2002-01-04  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* src/aterm-extension.c: Commented out functions converting to and
	from tcons/tnil tuples

2002-01-03  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* Release 0.6.4
	
2001-11-26  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* Release 0.6.3

2001-11-15  Merijn de Jonge <mdejonge@cwi.nl>
	
	* Updated dependencies in srts-0.6.3.pkg

2001-10-06  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	*  Release 0.6.2

2001-10-05  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* src/aterm-extension.c (ATmakeStringQ): Repair by Merijn de Jonge

2001-09-22  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* Release 0.6.1

2001-08-28  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* src/mprotect.[ch] (set_segv_handler): The solution of Merijn to
	mprotect the entire stack once at the start of execution did not
	completely work, maybe because only the parts of the stack that
	are already allocated are protected. Eelco Dolstra added a mechanism
	for trapping segmentation faults and mprotecting the stack at that
	point. This works!

2001-08-27  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* src/stratego.c: Save variables before PushChoice and restore
	them after failure.

2001-08-22  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* Run-time system for Stratego 0.6

2001-09-17  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* Stratego Run-time System separated from compiler to enable
	stand-alone distributions
