	* src/mprotect.[ch] (set_segv_handler): The solution of Merijn to
	mprotect the entire stack once at the start of execution did not
	completely work, maybe because only the parts of the stack that
	are already allocated are protected. Eelco Dolstra added a mechanism
	for trapping segmentation faults and mprotecting the stack at that
	point. This works!
