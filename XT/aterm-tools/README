 ATERM LIBRARY

 For the installation of GT, the ATerm library is required. The
 ATerm library can be obtained from

   http://www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/aterm/

 For installation of this library see the installation instructions
 included in the ATerm package


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 CONFIGURATION

 Set prefix to any appropriate value when installing and specify
 location of the ATerm library, e.g.,

 > ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-aterm=/aterm/install/directory

 This will cause executables to be installed in /usr/local/bin,
 libraries in /usr/local/lib, include files in /usr/local/include.

 Note that you need to include prefix/bin in your PATH, if it is not
 already.

 For information on other configuration parameters, type:

 > ./configure --help
