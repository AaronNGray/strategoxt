---------++!! Summary of Changes

- Added a new indentation-safe string interpolation syntax, which
  can be (ab)used to quickly construct strings. Strings
  can be quoted using $[ ... ], and anti-quoted using [ ... ].
  Alternatively, ${, $(, or $< and corresponding anti-quotations
  may also be used.

  Example:

    x      := $[ A extends B ];
    method := $[ void foo() {
                   ...
                 }
              ];
    !$[
        class Foo [x] {
          [method]
        }
    ]

  is equivalent to (note the indentation):

  !$[
  class Foo A extends B {
    void foo() {
      ...
    }
  }
  ]

  and is evaluated by a concat-strings application, resulting in
  a nicely indented string.

  Internally, asfix-imploder takes care of the indentation using a
  new {indentpadding} SDF annotation, which adds indentation padding
  to any lexical. (Using backtracking, this asfix-imploder modification
  should have very little performance effect on existing applications.)

  When needed, quotation characters can be escaped using dollars:
  $[ $]$ ] is equivalent to " ] ".

  Use responsibly!

- Option -O 2 now only inlines "internal" strategies and strategies
  defined within a "let". Option -O 3 now provides the old behavior,
  which leads to longer compilation times and larger executables at
  a questionable increase in runtime performance.
  
- Simplified the parsing API to eliminate parse table memoization.
  For example, parse-file(|<import-term(YourTable.tbl)>) now parses
  using YourTable.tbl.
