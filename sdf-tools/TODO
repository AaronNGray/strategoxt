  * Update README to new location of packages.
  
Old todo's:

* Fill-out the package description in desciption.pkg

* Update author information in the copyright notices
  and in the README.
  
* The following components need to berefactored because they contain a lot
  of scripting stuff that does not belong in the SDF-Tools package:
    - sdf-doc
    - sdf-label
    
* lib/text.r is obsolete and should be removed
