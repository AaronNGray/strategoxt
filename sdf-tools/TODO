	* syn/ATerms.sdf: consider move to aterm-tools
  * syn/*.sdf: Upgrade from SDF 2.1 to SDF 2.4
  * syn/Makefile.am: set deps


* Fill-out the package description in desciption.pkg
* Update author information in the copyright notices
  and in the README.
* The following components need to berefactored because they contain a lot
  of scripting stuff that does not belong in the SDF-Tools package:
    - sdf-doc
    - sdf-label
* Some components contain pretty-print tables, for which also the imploded
  pretty-print tables need to be installed. This woul dimpy an undesired
  dependency on the gpp pretty-print package. This problem should be fixed.
* sdf-doc contains GraphXML and dot related stuff that should be moved to
  the separate graph-tools package
* lib/graph-terms.r should be probably moved to the graph-tools package also
* lib/text.r is obsolete and should be removed
* lib/gt-paths.r.src shouild be renamed to sdf-tools-paths (or something)
