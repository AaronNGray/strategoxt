 CONFIGURATION

 Set prefix to any appropriate value when installing and specify
 location of the required packages e.g.

 > ./configure --prefix=/usr/local \
               --with-stratego=/stratego/install/directory \
               --with-asfix-tools=/asfix-tools/install/directory \
               --with-pgen=/pgen/install/directory \
               --with-graph-tools=/graph-tools/install/directory \
               --with-sglr=/sglr/install/directory

 This will cause executables to be installed in /usr/local/bin,
 libraries in /usr/local/lib, include files in /usr/local/include.

 Note that you need to include prefix/bin in your PATH, if it is not
 already.
