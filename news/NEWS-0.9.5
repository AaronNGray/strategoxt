---------++ Issue Tracking System

We have finally adopted an issue tracking system. Arthur van Dam
suggested to use JIRA. He has taken care of evaluating and installing
it. We have just started to use the system, but it already looks very
promosing. Please report issues to the JIRA issue tracking system from
now on. New issues are reported to the stratego-bugs mailing list. Of
course you are welcome to discuss issues at the stratego-dev mailing
list first.
