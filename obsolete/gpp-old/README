 Authors: Merijn de Jonge <mdejonge@cwi.nl>

----------------------------------------------------------------------

 GPP is a generxc pretty-printer that supports pretty-printing of
 parse-trees (AsFix) with comment preservation and of abstract syntax trees.
 GPP supports the output formats plain text, LaTeX, and HTML.
 Formattings are defined in pretty-print tables which can be generated from
 SDF syntax definitions.

 REQUIREMENTS

 For the installation of the GPP package, the following packages are
 required:

 - The Stratego compiler which can be obtained from

   http://www.stratego-language.org

 - The AsFix Tools package which can be obtaind from
   http://www.cwi.nl/~mdejonge/downloads

 - The SDF parser generator pgen which can be obtained from
   http://www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/pgen

 - The SGLR parser which can be obtained from
   http://www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/sglr

 - The graphviz graph visualization library package from AT&T (when using
   the tohtml tool) available from 
   http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 CONFIGURATION

 Set prefix to any appropriate value when installing and specify
 location of the Stratego compiler, the asfix tools package and the parser
 generator e.g.,

 > ./configure --prefix=/usr/local \
               --with-stratego=/stratego/install/directory \
               --with-asfix-tools=/asfix-tools/install/directory \
               --with-pgen=/pgen/install/directory \
               --with-sglr=/sglr/install/directory \
               --with-graphviz=/graphviz/install/directory

 This will cause executables to be installed in /usr/local/bin,
 libraries in /usr/local/lib, include files in /usr/local/include.

 Note that you need to include prefix/bin in your PATH, if it is not
 already.

 For information on other configuration parameters, type:

 > ./configure --help
