-asfix2box only works with context-free syntax sections. How to deal with
syntax sections has to be investigated.

-gpp depends on sdf.cons.tbl (part of sdf-tools). This table is now also
 included in the gpp package which might cause some maintenance overhead.
 Should sdf.cons.tbl be part of asfix-tools?
