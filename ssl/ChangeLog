    standard switches in parse-options.

    in Stratego.

2003-02-16  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/list-sort.str: quick sort by Rob Vermaas

2003-01-28  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	on priority and associativity information

2003-01-09  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * spec/list-misc.str: introduced flatten-list. flatten-list
    completely flattens a list. See list-misc-test for  
    examples.

2003-01-07  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * spec/conditional.str:

  - Introduced maybe/1. Maybe will apply specified strategy
    s. If s suceeds it will produce a Some with the result of
    s. Otherwise the result will be None. This is a bridge
    from the fail approach of Stratego to the Maybe approach
    of Haskell.

  - Introduced maybe/2. If the current term is Some(a) s1 will 
    be applied to a. Otherwise s2 will be applied to the
    empty tuple.
    
2003-01-04  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/iteration.str: don't define repeat/1 in terms of repeat/2

	* spec/list-basic.str: <for-each-pair(s)>(xs, ys) produces
	the list of pairs <s>(x,y) for each pair of x from xs and
	y from ys.

2002-12-31  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/exec.str: 

	- fork-and-wait fails if the child returns with a non-zero exit
	status.

	- call definined in terms of fork and execvp in Stratego; previous
	implementation was complex C implementation. 

	- call(init-child) is like call, but applies init-child in the
	child process before the execvp
		
	- redirect-stdout-to-file and redirect-stdin-from-file do as their
	name suggest. They can be used with call(...) to redirect input
	and/or output of the child process. Using this files can be copied
	using the cat program as follows:
	
	  cat :
	    (filein, fileout) -> fileout
	    where <call(<redirect-stdin-from-file> filein;
		        <redirect-stdout-to-file> fileout)> ("cat", [])

	Typical use of all this is to coerce programs that only read or
	write using stdio into using file io.

2002-12-30  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/string.str: get-filename removes path

	of stderr. (Then we can use help2man to generate man files.)

	* spec/dir.str: Including C function SSL_copy for verbatim copying
	of files.

	* spec/options.str: option-wrap is an abstraction for option handling
	that does determine the io behaviour, as does io-wrap. This is
	useful in combination with the XTC abstractions.

2002-12-15  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/Makefile.am: Installing module sources in ${pkgdatadir}/doc

	* spec/tables.str: table-append appends the new value list at the
	end of the list of entries

2002-12-13  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

2002-12-09  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/simple-list-traversal.r, spec/env-list-traversal.r: generic
	traversals in which lists are traversed by visiting head and tail,
	instead of visiting all elements (behaviour of all). Contributed by
	Otto Skrove Bagge.
	
	* spec/breadth-first.r: removed, was not correct

	* spec/annotation-props-test.r, spec/annotation-props.r:
	Operations to manipulate annotation lists composed of key value
	pairs. By Martin Bravenboer.

	* src/time.c, src/ssl-time.h, spec/time.r, spec/time-test.r,
	src/time.c, src/ssl-time.h: support for time measurements extended
	with primitives calling the system calls clock and time. Module
	time defines a number of useful abstractions over this. In
	particular, <run-time> returns the seconds of total run-time so
	far, including the run-time of any child processes.  The operator
	profile(msg, s) measures the time used to apply s and then prints
	user and system time, including children time.

	* spec/getopt.r, spec/io-test.r, spec/template-test.r,
	spec/substitution.r: copyright notice

	* spec/sunit.r, spec/string.r: layout

2002-06-08  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/io.r: layout

	* spec/integers.r: addS, subtS, etc. define operations on 
	integer strings. new-counter, reset-counter, etc. manipulate
	a named counter using dynamic rules.

	* spec/fixpoint-traversal.r: innermost-tagged uses annotations
	to tag terms that are in normal form.

	* spec/annotations-test.r: Extensive test of annotation
	functionality.  Written by Martin Bravenboer. Adapted to use list
	matching by EV.

	* spec/Makefile.am: Installing .rtree files (parsed modules)
	instead of .r files (sources); saves time when compiling and
	ensures syntactic correctness of library modules. First step
	towards separte compilation.

	there are failures. This makes it possible to combine several
	test-suites.

	* spec/annotations.r: Call the SSL wrappers to access annotations
	instead of directly calling the AT variants: no annotations is
	equivalent to the empty list of annotations. Has-annotation tests
	whether the result of get-annotations is not the empty list.

2002-05-10  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/fixpoint-traversal.r: innermost-tagged(s) uses annotations
	to tag terms in normal form to avoid renormalization

	* spec/list-zip.r: Definition of join(s) for creating and
	filtering the cartesian product of two lists.

	* spec/getopt.r: My getopt implementation used one-element tuples
	(to separate options without arguments from options with
	arguments), so it won't work with Stratego 0.7 (where (e) = e). --
	Otto Skrove Bagge

2002-03-14  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	connect-test.r, client-test.r, server-test.r: Primitives for
	interprocess communication contributed by Hedzer Westra

2002-02-19  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/getopt.r: I've written an option parser for Stratego.  I'm
	using it in CodeBoost now, without problems, but I haven't tested
	it extensively, so there may still be issues.  Source is attached
	to this email, with documentation.

	It handles most of the standard GNU / Unix option syntax: short
	options ("-a", "-b"), multiple short options in one word ("-ab"),
	short options with arguments ("-a foo", "-bbar"), long options
	("--long", "--long=arg", "--long arg"), options with optional
	arguments ("-f", "-ffoo", "--file", "--file=foo", etc.), and
	options that can be given mulitiple times.  A nicely formatted
	help text is created automatically.  Options are (by default)
	collected into a table, and can be retrieved at any time.
	Non-option arguments are collected and returned.

	I've only tested this with Stratego 0.6.4, so tweaking may be
	necessary to make it work on 0.7. -- Otto Bagge

2002-02-12  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/annotations.r: get-, set-, and rm-annotations are the SSL
	names of the corresponding ATerm annotation manipulation
	functions.

2002-01-22  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* src/io.c: Removed obsolete (commented out) code for consnil
	conversions. Including stratego header file as <srts/stratego.h> 
	
	* spec/simple-traversal.r: Strategy bottomup-para(s) implements
	paramorphism, which applies s at pair of orignal term and 
	term in which the subterms have been transformed.

	Don't use generated names in check; match instead.

	* spec/parse-options.r: Cons/Nil -> [_|_]/[]

	which s succeeds and returns them in post-order.

2002-01-04  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

2001-11-21  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* ssl/spec/list-set.r: collect-all and collect-om. Reformulated
	several collect strategies to use build-split pattern ![<s>].
