	Otto Skrove Bagge.
	
	* spec/breadth-first.r: removed, was not correct

	* spec/annotation-props-test.r, spec/annotation-props.r:
	Operations to manipulate annotation lists composed of key value
	pairs. By Martin Bravenboer.

	src/time.c, src/ssl-time.h: support for time measurements extended
	with primitives calling the system calls clock and time. Module
	time defines a number of useful abstractions over this. In
	particular, <run-time> returns the seconds of total run-time so
	far, including the run-time of any child processes.  The operator
	profile(msg, s) measures the time used to apply s and then prints
	user and system time, including children time.

	* spec/getopt.r, spec/io-test.r, spec/template-test.r,

	functionality.  Written by Martin Bravenboer. Adapted to use list
	matching by EV.

	* spec/Makefile.am: Installing .rtree files (parsed modules)
	instead of .r files (sources); saves time when compiling and
	ensures syntactic correctness of library modules. First step

	instead of directly calling the AT variants: no annotations is
	equivalent to the empty list of annotations. Has-annotation tests
	whether the result of get-annotations is not the empty list.

2002-05-10  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/fixpoint-traversal.r: innermost-tagged(s) uses annotations

	* spec/getopt.r: My getopt implementation used one-element tuples
	(to separate options without arguments from options with
	arguments), so it won't work with Stratego 0.7 (where (e) = e). --
	Otto Skrove Bagge

	interprocess communication contributed by Hedzer Westra

2002-02-19  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/getopt.r: I've written an option parser for Stratego.  I'm
	using it in CodeBoost now, without problems, but I haven't tested
	it extensively, so there may still be issues.  Source is attached
	to this email, with documentation.

	It handles most of the standard GNU / Unix option syntax: short
	options ("-a", "-b"), multiple short options in one word ("-ab"),
	short options with arguments ("-a foo", "-bbar"), long options
	("--long", "--long=arg", "--long arg"), options with optional
	arguments ("-f", "-ffoo", "--file", "--file=foo", etc.), and
	options that can be given mulitiple times.  A nicely formatted
	help text is created automatically.  Options are (by default)
	collected into a table, and can be retrieved at any time.
	Non-option arguments are collected and returned.

	I've only tested this with Stratego 0.6.4, so tweaking may be
	necessary to make it work on 0.7. -- Otto Bagge

2002-02-12  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/annotations.r: get-, set-, and rm-annotations are the SSL
	names of the corresponding ATerm annotation manipulation

2002-01-22  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* src/io.c: Removed obsolete (commented out) code for consnil
	conversions. Including stratego header file as <srts/stratego.h> 
	
	* spec/simple-traversal.r: Strategy bottomup-para(s) implements
	paramorphism, which applies s at pair of orignal term and 
	term in which the subterms have been transformed.

	Don't use generated names in check; match instead.

	* spec/parse-options.r: Cons/Nil -> [_|_]/[]
