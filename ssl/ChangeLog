	* spec/tables.str : Refactored the definition of merge operations
	on pairs of hashtables. There is now a single (78 LOC!) rule that
	defines many different scenarios for merging two hashtables. This
	hashtable-merge rule takes as arguments a number of switches for
	choosing the desired scenario.  For example, the following merge
	strategy is defined in terms of hashtable-merge:

	  hashtable-intersect-wempty(|tbl2, emptyElt) =
	    ?tbl1
	    ; !(tbl1, tbl2)
	    ; hashtable-merge(
		symmetric-no, 
		iterate1-yes, 
		iterate2-yes, 
		remove-no,	
		isect, 
		!emptyElt, 
		\ key -> <hashtable-get(|key)> tbl1 \,
		\ key -> <hashtable-get(|key)> tbl2 \
	    )

	The -yes, -no strategies are synonyms for id and fail and serve
	to remind us of the choices made in the instantiation. When
	good use is made of compile-time inlining and evaluation (constant
	folding), the generic algorithm should be reduced to a fairly
	decent specialized algorithm.
	
	* spec/dynamic-rules-refactored.str : Fixed bug in definition of
	dr-fork-and-union; now relevant entries that do not occur in a
	changeset, but are defined in the corresponding scope, are also
	retrieved when computing the union. Also generalized the merging
	of rule sets and the corresponding fork- and fix-
	operations. Instantiation for a specific merge operation is now a
	matter of a few lines.

2004-07-07  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/options.str: fix in the 'usage' invoked by iowrap. Also
	added an obsolete message to iowrap. This should stop the
	confusion about what to use, especially in combination with the
	stratego-warnings tool.

2004-07-04  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/options.str: io-wrap now has a variant that takes an
	explicit usage and about argument. These strategies are used if
	the users requests for help or information about the program. The
	changes are backwards compatible.

2004-06-15  Arthur van Dam <adam@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/sets.str:
	4 binary set operations, all operating on one input set 'set1':
	  iset-union(|set2)
	  iset-isect(|set2)
	  iset-subset(|set2)
	  iset-eq(|set2)

	* spec/dynamic-rules-refactored.str:
	  - Scope-identifier used as part of key in ChangeSets now is the
	    hashtable pointer of that scope (instead of scope label list).
	  - ChangeSets now also store new scope labels (if new ones are
	    added). For what it's worth.
	  - Both RuleScopes and ChangeSet now use IndexedSets for
	    maintaining scope labels, instead of a list.

2004-06-14  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/sets.str: new module providing an interface to ATerm's
	IndexedSets (stateful sets). Main strategies: new-iset,
	iset-add(|elem), iset-contains(|elem), iset-remove(|elem),
	iset-elements(|elem), iset-clear(|elem). For examples, see the
	sets-test module in the SSL tests directory.

2004-06-09  Valentin David  <valentin@lrde.epita.fr>

	* spec/file.str (remove-extension): Do not use string-tokenize any
	more to not loose multiple dots.

2004-05-30  Arthur van Dam <adam@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/string.str: `newname' and `newname-shared' strategies that
	generate unique strings with user-defined prefix. The increasing
	counter that is used as postfix can be shared among various
	`newname' calls that use the same countergroup.

	newname -- use current term as prefix and groupname (i.e. each
	prefix has its own numbering starting at 0)
	newname-shared -- use current term as prefix and use a global
	counter (groupname = "")
	newname(|groupname) -- use current term as prefix and number within
	specified groupname.

	Note that uniqueness-checking occurs over any grouping or scoping,
	no previously used string (within one program run) will ever be
	returned by newname.

2004-04-28  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/placeholder.str: new SSL module that adds library support
	for ATerm placeholders to Stratego. 

	get-placeholder -- Returns the placeholder of an ATerm placeholder.
	make-placeholder -- Creates a placeholder.
	is-placeholder -- Checks if the current term is a placeholder.

	* test/placeholder-test.str: testsuite for placeholders.
	
2004-04-13  Arthur van Dam <adam@cs.uu.nl>

	* dynamic-rules-refactored.str: moved from experimental into SSL.

	* dynamic-rules-(lowlevel|highlevel)-test.str: two testsuites for
	testing both low- and highlevel API (needs some more tests).

	* dynamic-rules.str: imports the dynamic-rules-refactored by
	default, no name-clashes between old and new dr-strategies of course.

2004-03-22  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* collect.str: improved the documentation of the collect
	strategies.

	* collect.str: added collect-all and collect-om with three
	arguments: s, union and skip. The skip strategy can be used to
	reduce the current term to skip parts of it. It is not higher
	order, but a simple term to term strategy.
	
2004-04-06  Eelco Visser <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* tables.str: hashtable-intersect and hashtable-union
	- change the argument table
	- fail if no changes are made
	- assume that values are lists

	- hashtable-pushlist
	- hashtable-pushunion

2004-04-04  Arthur van Dam <adam@cs.uu.nl>

	* tables.str :
	All primitive calls to the legacy table functions are now replaced
	by (non-primitive) hashtable-* calls. Behaviour is of course still
	the same.

	- table-hashtable() makes the legacy table-table available as a
	Hashtable.

2004-04-02  Arthur van Dam <adam@cs.uu.nl>

	* tables.str: Added bulk operations
	- hashtable-putlist(|kv*)
	- hashtable-getlist
	- hashtable-copy

2004-04-01  Arthur van Dam <adam@cs.uu.nl>

	* tables.str: Added stack-operations for stacks stored in hashtables.
	- hashtable-push(|key, value)
	- hashtable-pop(|key)
	- hashtable-peek(|key)
	- hashtable-peekpop(|key)

2004-03-22  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* ssl/table.str: 
	- new-hashtable =
	- new-hashtable(|initial_size, max_load)
	- hashtable-destroy
	- hashtable-put(|key, value)
	- hashtable-get(|key)
	- hashtable-remove(|key)
	- hashtable-keys

	Hashtable strategies that operate on an Hashtable representation
	in an ATerm. These strategies require you to pass this
	representation around in Stratego, not the name of a
	hashtable. The internal structure of this representation should
	not be used in any way and is subject to change (compare to Stream
	as ATerm).

2004-03-07  Arthur van Dam <adam@cs.uu.nl>

	* ssl/list-set.str: Introduced a general subset checker.
	End user strategies include: `set-eq`, `subset`, `subseteq`, all
	parameterizable with a user-defined compare/eq strategy.

2004-02-22  Merijn de Jonge <mdejonge@cs.uu.nl>

	* Makefile.am: added autoxt.m4 to EXTRA_DIST
	* Makefile.am: added line: ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I . such that autoreconf
	can find autoxt.m4

2004-02-12  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* ssl/term-io.str: added write-to-string. This strategies takes an
	ATerm and returns the ATerm in a String.

2004-02-12  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* ssl/term-io.str: add read-from-string. This strategies takes a
	String and returns the ATerm in this String.

	* ssl/term-io.str: removed print-stack since it is completely
	obsolete.

2004-01-20  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/scoped-finite-map.str: Table manipulation operations for
	implementation of 'extend rules' and 'extend override rules'.
	Instead of maintaining a single list of values for a key, there is
	a list of values for each scope.

2003-12-24  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/posix-file.str: added chdir to change the current working
	directory. Note that chdir implements the error reporting in the
	SSL itself now we have a perror in the SSL. If you really want no
	warning, then you can use the plain primitive.

	This kind of error-reporting is very easy to implement in
	Stratego:

	?pathname; prim("SSL_chdir", pathname) => 0
	<+ < conc-strings
	   ; perror
	   ; fail
	   > ("SSL/chdir: Cannot change current working directory to ", <id>)

	This will for example output the following message if the pathname
	does not exist:
	
        SSL/chdir: Cannot change current working directory to /tddmp: No
	such file or directory

	* tests/posix-file-test.str: tests for chdir

	* Adding new primitives is quite complex now we have separation
	compilation with SSL libraries in the SRTS ...

2003-12-21  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/posix-process.str: added execv.

	Note that the implementation in the runtime does not add the
	program to the list of argument. execvp does this, which is
	horrible. I think this should be changed in the runtime part of
	execvp and the invocations to execvp should be adapated.
	
2003-12-19  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* Improvements for separate compilation
	  - added more modules to lib; since liblib should be
	    the default module to be imported in programs, there
	    should be not need to import other modules that partly
	    overlap. Added annotation-props, sunit. Also added
	    constructor declarations for tuples to library instead
	    of in compiler. 
	  - (In the future it might be interesting to split the
	     library into smaller parts.)
	  - uncify reverses the cification of function names 

	* liblib is a library derived from lib.str. The compiler generates
	liblib.c from which an object library is produced, liblib.str,
	a Stratego module with external definitions for all the definitions
	in lib, and liblib.rtree. Instead of importing lib or some sub-modules
	in a program, one should now (when desired) import liblib. In addition
	it is then necessary to link against the object library. When using
	Makefile.xt this can be done as follows (for a program file.str):

	   file_LDADD = -lliblib $(STRATEGORUNLIBS)

2003-12-09  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/posix-file.str: added getcwd

	* spec/file.str: added abspath, is-abspath, is-relpath,
	base-filename.

	* spec/file-tests.str: tests for these strategies.
	
2003-12-09  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/file.str: added pathname manipulations, removed them from
	string.str

	* spec/file.str: corrected documentation of basename strategy

	* spec/file-test.str: same for tests
	
2003-12-04  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/posix-error.str: added perror and strerror.
	
	* spec/posix-error-test.str: testsuite for strategies in
	posix-error.

2003-12-01  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/parenthesize.str: fixed problem with unary operators. Added
	a Disambiguate(paren) rule for these cases.

	* tests/parenthesize-test.str: started a testsuite for parenthesize.

2003-11-16  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/string.str: get-extension from filename

2003-09-23  Merijn de Jonge <m.de.jonge@cwi.nl>

2003-09-17  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/posix-error.str: new module

	because of an XDEV error. Thanks to Arthur van Dam for reporting
	this problem.

	* spec/list-misc.str: added split-last.

2003-09-16  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/integers.str: added set-random-seed, get-random-max, and
	next-random to generate random numbers.

2003-08-17  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/list-misc.str: mapconcat(s) is shortcut for (map(s);
	concat)

2003-08-15  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/string.str: added unescape-chars(s) to allow the
	specification of UnEscape rules to apply.

	* spec/string.str: added unquote(s1, s2) to allow different start
	and end 'quotes'. Typical examples: [ ] or ( ).

	* Some xDoc comments.

2003-08-14  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/parenthesize.str: fixed typo in gen-right. GenLeftAssoc
	should be GenRightAssoc.

	* Moved parenthesize-test.str to tests directory.

2003-08-12  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/scoped-finite-map.str: At the end of a rule scope, remove
	the entry for the lhs if there are no more rules in scope. These
	entries used to clutter the tables representing dynamic rules;
	possibly causing overhead for manipulation of dynamic rules in
	data-flow optimizations.

2003-08-12  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

  * spec/process.str: defined call/(0,0) in terms of call(1,0)

    a user specified union strategy.

  * xDoc comments

2003-08-07  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

  * Moved strlen en strcat from posix-file to string.
  * Defined string-length in terms of strlen.
  * Defined conc-strings in terms of strcat.

  * new-concat-strings is now concat-strings.

  * Added some xDoc comments.

2003-08-01  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

  * spec/list-misc: split-at is an alias of split-fetch.
    Reported by Arthur van Dam

  * spec/list-basic: xDoc for split-fetch.

2003-07-29  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/list-basic.str: reverse-map(s) applies s to elements in
	reverse order; useful for data-flow optimizations.

2003-07-29  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/int-list.str: added range strategy, inspired by
    Python's range function. The range strategy produces
    lists of ints given a range, step or step strategy.

  * spec/simple-traversal.str: corrected the order of 
    higher order strategy arguments.

2003-07-15  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/list-basic.str: definitions of map1 and listbu1 require that
	at least one application succeeds.

2003-06-10  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * spec/parse-options.str: --about and --version are now
    standard switches in parse-options.

  * spec/options.str: version-option in is now defined 
    as fail. It will show an obsolete message when directly 
    used.

2003-06-09  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * spec/posix-signal.str: prefixed signal overlays with
    SIG. Reported by Karina.

  * test/posix-process-test.str: unit testing of 
    posix-process primitives.

2003-05-28  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * spec/list-misc.str: documented fold strategies

  * spec/parse-options.str: allow overriding of 
    system-usage strategy.

2003-03-28  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * spec/char-io.str: added read-text-from-stream, 
    currently based on fgetc.

2003-03-28  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * spec/term-io.str: defined ReadFromFile, WriteToTextFile
    and WriteToBinaryFile in terms of new POSIX
    strategies. Behaviour should be exactly the same
    as the native implementations.

2003-03-27  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * spec/term-io.str: added fprint: print implemented
    in Stratego.

2003-03-27  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * spec/posix-file.str: added fputc and more tests for
    the posix-file module.

2003-03-25  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * spec/file.str: added POSIX compatible dirname and
    some more file property checks.

2003-03-25  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * spec/file.str: added can-read-file and can-write-file.

  * spec/posix-file.str: added access.

  * spec/file.str: started moving abstractions to file.
    Same will happen for process, aterm-io and char-io.

2003-03-24  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * spec/io.str: defined ReadFromFile, WriteToTextFile
    and WriteToBinaryFile in terms of new POSIX
    strategies. Behaviour should be exactly the same
    as the native implementations.

  * spec/posix-file.str: added fgetc

  * spec/io.str: deprecated getchar

2003-03-24  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * spec/posix-file.str: split write-to-stream 
    in baf/taf/text. Note the failing test with taf.

2003-03-24  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * spec/posix-file.str: new stream representation

  * spec/posix-file.str: added fopen, strlen, strcat,
    stdin-stream, stdout-stream, open-stream and
    rewritten all code to new stream representation.

2003-03-21  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

    operations, mostly from exec.str. Improved
    documentation and grouping of strategies.
    
  * spec/posix-file.str: collected POSIX file 
    operations from exec.str and io.str
    
  * spec/posix-process.str: fork-and-wait: show

    of a signal (useful for segmentation faults)

  * spec/pipe.str: moved WaitStatus operations
    to posix-process.str
    
2003-03-19  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* spec/connect.str: removed
	* spec/server-test.str: removed
  
  * Removed socket modules. Might go into stratego-net 
    in the future

2003-02-16  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/list-sort.str: quick sort by Rob Vermaas

2003-01-28  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * spec/io.str: introduced fflush to fflush
    open files or stdout/stderr.

2003-01-26  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/fixpoint-traversal.str: Removed spurious rec from definition
	of innermost.

2003-01-25  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/simple-traversal.str: Turned top-level local recursion into
	recursive definition

	* spec/list-set-test.str: test for collect with skip

2003-01-11  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/parenthesize.str: place parentheses based
	on priority and associativity information

2003-01-09  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * spec/list-misc.str: introduced flatten-list. flatten-list
    completely flattens a list. See list-misc-test for  
    examples.

2003-01-07  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * spec/conditional.str:

  - Introduced maybe/1. Maybe will apply specified strategy
    s. If s suceeds it will produce a Some with the result of
    s. Otherwise the result will be None. This is a bridge
    from the fail approach of Stratego to the Maybe approach
    of Haskell.

  - Introduced maybe/2. If the current term is Some(a) s1 will 
    be applied to a. Otherwise s2 will be applied to the
    empty tuple.
    
2003-01-04  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/iteration.str: don't define repeat/1 in terms of repeat/2

	* spec/list-basic.str: <for-each-pair(s)>(xs, ys) produces
	the list of pairs <s>(x,y) for each pair of x from xs and
	y from ys.

2002-12-31  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/exec.str: 

	- fork-and-wait fails if the child returns with a non-zero exit
	status.

	- call definined in terms of fork and execvp in Stratego; previous
	implementation was complex C implementation. 

	- call(init-child) is like call, but applies init-child in the
	child process before the execvp
		
	- redirect-stdout-to-file and redirect-stdin-from-file do as their
	name suggest. They can be used with call(...) to redirect input
	and/or output of the child process. Using this files can be copied
	using the cat program as follows:
	
	  cat :
	    (filein, fileout) -> fileout
	    where <call(<redirect-stdin-from-file> filein;
		        <redirect-stdout-to-file> fileout)> ("cat", [])

	Typical use of all this is to coerce programs that only read or
	write using stdio into using file io.

2002-12-30  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/string.str: get-filename removes path

	* spec/list-basic.str: at-suffix-rev looks for suffix starting at
	end of list

2002-12-18  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/verbose.str: pass-verbose to pass verbose option to children

	* spec/pack-modules.str: Refactored using new (config-style) option handling.

	* spec/file.str: find-file(ext) is new; refactored other definitions

	* spec/sunit.str, spec/pipe.str: unbound variable fixes

	* spec/sunit.str: Adapted to comply with more strict checks
	for unbound variables in frontend.

2002-12-17  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/: cosmetics

2002-12-16  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/string.str: Removed calls to debug in unescape-chars

	* spec/parse-options.str: Writing usage information to stdout instead
	of stderr. (Then we can use help2man to generate man files.)

	* spec/dir.str: Including C function SSL_copy for verbatim copying
	of files.

	* spec/options.str: option-wrap is an abstraction for option handling

	useful in combination with the XTC abstractions.

	src/time.c, src/ssl-time.h: support for time measurements extended
	with primitives calling the system calls clock and time. Module
	time defines a number of useful abstractions over this. In
	particular, <run-time> returns the seconds of total run-time so
	far, including the run-time of any child processes.  The operator
	profile(msg, s) measures the time used to apply s and then prints
	user and system time, including children time.

	equivalent to the empty list of annotations. Has-annotation tests
	whether the result of get-annotations is not the empty list.

	interprocess communication contributed by Hedzer Westra

2002-02-19  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/getopt.r: I've written an option parser for Stratego.  I'm
	using it in CodeBoost now, without problems, but I haven't tested
	it extensively, so there may still be issues.  Source is attached
	to this email, with documentation.

	It handles most of the standard GNU / Unix option syntax: short
	options ("-a", "-b"), multiple short options in one word ("-ab"),
	short options with arguments ("-a foo", "-bbar"), long options
	("--long", "--long=arg", "--long arg"), options with optional
	arguments ("-f", "-ffoo", "--file", "--file=foo", etc.), and
	options that can be given mulitiple times.  A nicely formatted
	help text is created automatically.  Options are (by default)
	collected into a table, and can be retrieved at any time.
	Non-option arguments are collected and returned.

	I've only tested this with Stratego 0.6.4, so tweaking may be
	necessary to make it work on 0.7. -- Otto Bagge

2002-02-12  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/annotations.r: get-, set-, and rm-annotations are the SSL

2002-01-22  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* src/io.c: Removed obsolete (commented out) code for consnil
	conversions. Including stratego header file as <srts/stratego.h> 
	
	* spec/simple-traversal.r: Strategy bottomup-para(s) implements
	paramorphism, which applies s at pair of orignal term and 
	term in which the subterms have been transformed.
