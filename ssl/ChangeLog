	* spec/list-basic.r: bug in definition of reverse-acc

2002-01-26  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/list-basic.r: reverse(s) applies s to the elements of the
	list that is reversed (Suggested by Otto Skrove Bagge)

2002-01-22  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* src/io.c: Removed obsolete (commented out) code for consnil
	conversions. Including stratego header file as <srts/stratego.h> 
	
	* spec/simple-traversal.r: Strategy bottomup-para(s) implements
	paramorphism, which applies s at pair of orignal term and 
	term in which the subterms have been transformed.

	* spec/rename-test.r: Made tests insensitive to constant caching.
	Don't use generated names in check; match instead.

	* spec/parse-options.r: Cons/Nil -> [_|_]/[]

	* spec/integers.r: Operator log2 takes the base 2
	logarithm. Constructor Infinite represents infinity, operators
	add-inf and lt-inf are aware of Infinite.

	* spec/list-set.r: postorder-collect(s) selects all subterms for
	which s succeeds and returns them in post-order.

2002-01-10  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* Release 0.7beta
	
	* src/io.c, src/string.c, src/tables.c: Removed conversions
	between native and Cons/Nil lists.

	* spec/options-test.r: TCons -> (.,.) 

	* spec/list-zip.r: Moved tuple operations to tuple.r

	* spec/list-misc.r: Moved tuple operations to tuple.r

	* spec/list-filter.r: Refactored definition of partition using
	term wrap and match project. Problem with old definition was that
	it constructed an intermediate list with a pair as tail. This
	fails after the introduction of native lists.

	* spec/list-basic.r: layout + refactored reverse

2002-01-04  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>
	
	* spec/tuple-test.r: Tests for operations on tuples

	* spec/exec-test.r: Refactored to be independent of additional
	files.

	* spec/tuple-cons.r: Commented declaration of TNil and TCons;
	should no longer be used for the representation of tuples.

	* spec/list-zip.r: Moved tuple related operations to tuple.r

	* spec/tuple.r: Redefined rules and strategies to use new
	representation of tuples. Generic tuple access defined in terms of
	explode/implode and list operations; expensive! Added TupleToList
	and ListToTuple.

	* src/term.c (SSL_explode_term, SSL_mkterm): Refactored for fixed
	length tuples

	* spec/pack.r: refactored (introduction of fixed length tuples)

2002-01-03  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* Release 0.6.4
	
2001-12-18  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/memo.r: Refactored definition of memoization strategy
	using dynamic rules.

	* spec/fixpoint-traversal.r: Added definition of innermost-memo

2001-12-17  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/scoped-finite-map.r: Refactored definition of scope using
	restore-always

	* spec/options.r: Refactored definitions using term wrap syntax.

	* spec/io.r: Refactored definitions of debug and such using
	term wrap syntax.

	* spec/conditional.r: restore and restore-always catch failure
	of a strategy and perform a restoring action before failing
	again (after an idea from Martin Bravenboer)

2001-11-26  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* Release 0.6.3

2001-11-22  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/list-index.r: insert strategy inserts an element at an
	index position in the list (shifting the rest) (Otto Skrove Bagge)

2001-11-21  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* ssl/spec/list-set.r: collect-all and collect-om. Reformulated
	several collect strategies to use build-split pattern ![<s>].

	* spec/list-set-test.r: tests for collect-all and collect-om

	* spec/string-test.r: tests for string sorting

2001-11-15  Merijn de Jonge  <mdejonge@cwi.nl>
	* updated dependencies in ssl-0.6.3.pkg
	* term.c: mkterm fix: quoting is now correct.
	* Removed unused AC_ARG_WITH calls from configure.in
	* Renamed --with-stratego-rts switch to --with-srts to standardise
	  names of configuration switches amongst different packages.

2001-10-06  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/string.r (string-gt): use strcasecmp instead of strcmp so
	no distinction between upper and lower case is made.

	*  Release 0.6.2

	* src/term.c (SSL_explode_term): Fix of the bug in the previou fix
	(Merijn de Jonge)

2001-10-05  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/parse-options.r, spec/options.r, spec/option-demo.r:
	Extension of options that prints usage information. (Merijn de
	Jonge)

	* src/term.c (SSL_explode_term): Repair string handling (Merijn de Jonge)

2001-09-28  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/free-variables.r: Replaced collect-kids with crush/3
	* Numerous small refactorings
	* Additional tests

2001-09-22  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* Release 0.6.1

2001-09-17  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

2001-09-16  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* src/string.c (SSL_is_string): Casting ATmakeInt to ATerm

	* src/Makefile.am: Using -O2 to compile C sources

	* src/io.c: Removed unused variables. Cast ATmakeInts to ATerms.

	* spec/pack-graph.r: Added yet another version of the packing
	algorithm; this needs to be refactored.

	* spec/simple-traversal.r: oncetd-stop: stop argument called
	without strategy argument; apparently this strategy was never
	used by anyone.

	* spec/reals.r: atan2 takes two arguments

2001-09-15  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/exec.r: Renamed pipe'/3 into pipe/3

2001-09-09  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/pack-modules.r: changed use of open-file

	* spec/simple-traversal.r: Added type annotations for higher-order
	arguments.

2001-09-07  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/io.r: open-file used to open a file for writing; it has
	been changed to pass a mode explicitly using a string.  Call
	<open-file> (file, mode), where mode is "w" or "r".

	* spec/io.r: <getchar> file reads next character from file

	* spec/io.r: <readline> file reads next line from file

2001-08-27  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/pack-modules.r: Separate lines in dependency file with a
	newline to prevent make from choking on too long lines
	(hopefully).

	* Library for Stratego 0.6
