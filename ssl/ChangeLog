	connect-test.r, client-test.r, server-test.r: Primitives for
	interprocess communication contributed by Hedzer Westra

2002-02-19  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/getopt.r: I've written an option parser for Stratego.  I'm
	using it in CodeBoost now, without problems, but I haven't tested
	it extensively, so there may still be issues.  Source is attached
	to this email, with documentation.

	It handles most of the standard GNU / Unix option syntax: short
	options ("-a", "-b"), multiple short options in one word ("-ab"),
	short options with arguments ("-a foo", "-bbar"), long options
	("--long", "--long=arg", "--long arg"), options with optional
	arguments ("-f", "-ffoo", "--file", "--file=foo", etc.), and
	options that can be given mulitiple times.  A nicely formatted
	help text is created automatically.  Options are (by default)
	collected into a table, and can be retrieved at any time.
	Non-option arguments are collected and returned.

	I've only tested this with Stratego 0.6.4, so tweaking may be
	necessary to make it work on 0.7. -- Otto Bagge

2002-02-12  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/annotations.r: get-, set-, and rm-annotations are the SSL
	names of the corresponding ATerm annotation manipulation
	functions.

2002-01-27  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/list-basic.r: bug in definition of reverse-acc

2002-01-26  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/list-basic.r: reverse(s) applies s to the elements of the
	list that is reversed (Suggested by Otto Skrove Bagge)

2002-01-22  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* src/io.c: Removed obsolete (commented out) code for consnil
	conversions. Including stratego header file as <srts/stratego.h> 
	
	* spec/simple-traversal.r: Strategy bottomup-para(s) implements
	paramorphism, which applies s at pair of orignal term and 
	term in which the subterms have been transformed.

	* spec/rename-test.r: Made tests insensitive to constant caching.
	Don't use generated names in check; match instead.

	* spec/parse-options.r: Cons/Nil -> [_|_]/[]

	* spec/integers.r: Operator log2 takes the base 2
	logarithm. Constructor Infinite represents infinity, operators
	add-inf and lt-inf are aware of Infinite.

	* spec/list-set.r: postorder-collect(s) selects all subterms for
	which s succeeds and returns them in post-order.

2002-01-10  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* Release 0.7beta
	
	* src/io.c, src/string.c, src/tables.c: Removed conversions
	between native and Cons/Nil lists.

	* spec/list-misc.r: Moved tuple operations to tuple.r

	* spec/list-filter.r: Refactored definition of partition using
	term wrap and match project. Problem with old definition was that
	it constructed an intermediate list with a pair as tail. This
	fails after the introduction of native lists.

	* spec/list-basic.r: layout + refactored reverse

2002-01-04  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>
	
	* spec/tuple-test.r: Tests for operations on tuples

	* spec/exec-test.r: Refactored to be independent of additional

	should no longer be used for the representation of tuples.

	* spec/list-zip.r: Moved tuple related operations to tuple.r

	* spec/tuple.r: Redefined rules and strategies to use new
	representation of tuples. Generic tuple access defined in terms of
	explode/implode and list operations; expensive! Added TupleToList
	and ListToTuple.

	* src/term.c (SSL_explode_term, SSL_mkterm): Refactored for fixed
	length tuples

	* spec/pack.r: refactored (introduction of fixed length tuples)

	term wrap syntax.

	of a strategy and perform a restoring action before failing
	again (after an idea from Martin Bravenboer)

2001-11-26  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* Release 0.6.3

2001-11-22  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/list-index.r: insert strategy inserts an element at an
	index position in the list (shifting the rest) (Otto Skrove Bagge)

2001-11-21  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* ssl/spec/list-set.r: collect-all and collect-om. Reformulated
	several collect strategies to use build-split pattern ![<s>].

	* spec/string-test.r: tests for string sorting

2001-11-15  Merijn de Jonge  <mdejonge@cwi.nl>

	  names of configuration switches amongst different packages.

2001-10-06  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/string.r (string-gt): use strcasecmp instead of strcmp so
	no distinction between upper and lower case is made.

	*  Release 0.6.2

	* src/term.c (SSL_explode_term): Fix of the bug in the previou fix
	(Merijn de Jonge)

2001-10-05  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/pack-graph.r: Added yet another version of the packing
	algorithm; this needs to be refactored.

	* spec/simple-traversal.r: oncetd-stop: stop argument called
	without strategy argument; apparently this strategy was never
	used by anyone.

2001-08-27  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>
