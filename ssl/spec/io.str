\literate[io]

	\begin{abstract}

	A transformation system needs to input terms to transform
	and output transformed terms. Instead of providing a single
	fixed mechanism for IO, this module
	defines primitives for file input and output of
	terms and strings. These primitives can be used in a variety
	of ways to define customized IO.

	\end{abstract}

	A compiled Stratego specification applies the strategy
	\verb|main| to the command line options that it gets. When
	interpreting these it will probably be necessary to read in
	a term from file and later write the transformed term back
	to (another) file. This module provides the primitives for
	doing file input and output. Module \verb|options| defines
	strategies to parse and analyze the command line options.

\begin{code}
module io
imports
   /* io modules */
   file dir pipe char-io term-io exec

\end{code}
