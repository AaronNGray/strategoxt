Version 0.10 released 2004-may-05
   * Updated URLs in README file that is part of generated bundles.
   * collect.sh: added support for subversion. A location field starting
     with 'svn:' is considerd a subversion address. What remains after
     'svn:' is considered as a subversion repository.
   * Autobundle now supports timed dependencies. To that end, the syntax of
     package definitions has been extended with a 'build-time requires' and
     a 'run-time requires' section, which serve to declare build-time and
     run-time dependencies. Packages declared in the 'requires' section are
     considered build-time and run-time dependencies. All requires sections
     are optional. 
     
     Timed dependencies serve to improve circular dependencies. Only when
     two packages have a build-time dependency on each other, bundlegen will
     raise an error.
   * Added support for package-based software development (see Merijn de
     Jonge (2003). Package-Based Software Development). New tools added:
     - pkg-edit: to put package in development mode
     - pkg-release: to release package and put it in deployment mode 
     - pkg-revert: to put pacakge in deployment mode without release
     - pkg-set: to change (some of) the contents of package definition
       files. Currently supported are: version, (primary) location, version
       numbers in package dependencies.
   * Bug fix: default component binding was not displayed correctly in
     autobundle's usage message.
   * Bug fix: Fixed installation/deinstallation of packages and
     documentation in bundled Makefile.
   * Bug fix: detecting when a parameter is bound more then once has been
     fixed. Bundlegen will terminate when mutpe parameter bindings are
     detected.
   * Bug fix: AUTOBUNDLE_SEARCH_PATH had incorrect priority. I.e., it
     overrides -I command line switches
       
       
Version 0.9.9 released 2004-feb-09
   * Building a composition now consists of executing "$(MAKE) all install"
     for each bundled component. This way a component only gets installed
     when its build succeeded. Previously only "$(MAKE) install" was
     executed, which could result in an incomplete installation when the
     build failed somewhere.
   * Autobundle tools now use and generate configure.ac (collect.sh still
     support configure.in though).
   * Added experimental '-B' to autobundle/bundlegen which gives more
     control over how dependency parameters are bouund. They used to get
     bound to ${prefix}, but now you can use, for instance,
     -b ${top_builddir}/../%c, to bind to a components source tree.

Version 0.9.8 released 2003-11-15
   * Bug fix release. Version resolution contained a bug that could
     hang bundlegen.

Version 0.9.7 released 2003-11-10
   * Refactorings
   * Cleaned-up bundled configure.in script. The file acinclude.m4 now

   * Created OPB logo for Online Package Bases
   * Renamed .r to .str files
   * Autobundle now makes use of recent enhancements of automake/autoconf
   * Buildprocess now makes use of Makefile.xt. No longer use of
     configure.in.src and package.conf files
   * bundlegen: complete new implementation which is faster and more robust
     (Cyclic dependencies can now be handled).

Version 0.5.6 released: 2003-10-23
   * pkgs2form.r: generated HTML now displays number of packages and
     number of versions
   * opb.conf.sample: HTML_HEADER now points to header.html in package
     repository instead of the one in $(pkgdatadir)

   * Fixed bug where "dependency" button activated search function.
   * Dependency graphs are now always created in separate window

Version 0.5.4 released: 2003-10-14
   * pkgs2form.r: Fixed bug where pressing the enter button in the search
     input entry activated the bundle action in stead of a search.

Version 0.5.3 released: 2003-10-13
   * Changes to make 'make distcheck' work
   * package.conf: updated package version requirements
   * configure.in.src: update for recent autoconf/automake version

   * Makefile.am's make_rules.stratego: changed SC/SCFLAGS by STRC/STRCFLAGS
   * Added dependency on dot-tools packages (because of Dot.pp)
   * autobundle/Makefile.am.templ: removed ulimit because it turns out not
     to be portable
   * autobundle/collect.sh: standarized url syntax (i.e., http://, cvs://,
     file://
   * autobundle/collect.sh: added libtoolize and rearranged tool chain

Version 0.5.2 released: 2003-08-7
   * autobundle/Makefile.am.templ: added $(mkinstalldirs) $(docdir)

     script for initializing new package bases.

     package bases

   * bundle2configure now support the --enable configuration switch for
     Switch terms. 
   * bundle2configure: Each component is now configured with the additional
     --with-bundled-packages switch. It is configured with the complete list
