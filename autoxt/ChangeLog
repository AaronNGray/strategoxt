2004-06-27   Martin Bravenboer  <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* autoxt.m4: added XT_PKG_STRATEGOXT, which checks if the
	(not) specified location of strategoxt is ok. Should not be used
	in StrategoXT packages: use it in packages that depend on
	StrategoXT.

2004-06-27   Martin Bravenboer  <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* autoxt.m4: added XT_SETUP where all stuff can be invoked that
	always has to be done in configure to be able to build a Stratego
	package. USE_XT_PACKAGES requires XT_SETUP, so legacy packages
	will always invoke this macro.

	* autoxt.m4: XT_SETUP sets and Automake conditionel XT_DARWIN. It
	would be useful to have an AC_DARWIN macro in Autoconf itself
	(See UNIX Variants in manual).

	* Makefile.xt: use the XT_DARWIN conditional to add the
	build_at_load option to LDFLAGS. The is required since the linker
	of Darwin use lazy invocation of initializers by default. This
	does not work for Stratego programs that use separate compilation.

2004-06-27   Martin Bravenboer  <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* autoxt.m4: added a set of macros for checking package
	dependencies:
	
	- XT_PKG_ATERM
        - XT_PKG_PGEN
	- XT_PKG_SGLR
	- XT_PKG_PT_SUPPORT
	- XT_PKG_ASF_LIBRARY
	- XT_PKG_SDF

	These macros delegate the real work to some specific program
	checks:

	- XT_PROG_SDF2TABLE
	- XT_PROG_IMPLODEPT
	- XT_PROG_SGLR
	- XT_PROG_BAFFLE
	- XT_LIB_ATERM

2004-06-27   Martin Bravenboer  <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* Makefile.xt: implemented support for build-time XTC
	repositories. The bin_PROGRAMS, pkgdata_DATA and so on are now
	registered in a local XTC repository, which contains references to
	the files in the build/source tree. This makes it possible to
	execute XTC-based programs in the source tree before
	installing. This is particularly useful for implementing support
	for doing a pre-install check.

	StrategoXT doesn't support this yet, so don't get too excited. All
	Makefile.ams that invoke TESTS need to define the build-time XTC
	repository in the TESTS_ENVIRONMENT if they want to support an
	pre-install check.

	* autoxt.m4: added flag for the location of build-time XTC
	repository. Defaults to 'XTC' in the top build directory (pwd).

	* Makefile.xt: removed rule for producing the ancient xtc-conf.h.

2004-06-25   Martin Bravenboer  <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* Makefile.xt: Added the new stratego-choice library to LDADD and
	and STRATEGORUNLIBS. This library is the default choice point
	implementation, which is now separate from the runtime.

	* Makefile.xt: Added the 'relname' command to facilitate
	meta-package tools (buildfarm). 'make relname' writes the basename
	of distribution files (tarballs, rpms) to a file relname. This
	file can then read if a tool needs to now the name of the
	distribution.

2004-05-04   Merijn de Jonge  <mdejonge@cs.uu.nl>
	
	* Makefile.xt: Fixed generation of pretty-print tables during 
	'make distcheck'.

2004-03-26   Martin Bravenboer  <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* Added the XT_TERM_DEFINE macro, which defines ATerm variants for
	PACKAGE_NAME, PACKAGE_VERSION, etc.
	
2004-03-02   Merijn de Jonge  <mdejonge@cs.uu.nl>
	* Makefile.am: added trailing newline
	* Makefile.xt: integrated pptable-diff in build process of
	  pretty-print tables. Build now fails when inconsistentent
	  pretty-print tables are detected
        * Makefile.xt: touch pretty-print table when grammar has changed
          and pretty-print table is consistent

2003-12-11  Martin Bravenboer  <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* autoxt.m4: added improved DETECT_SVN_REVISION AC macro. It
	determines the SVN revision of the source tree using svn status |
	awk or svn-revision. Arthur van Dam contributed to the fetching of
	the correct revision.

2003-12-05  Martin Bravenboer  <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* Makefile.xt: In the .sdf.def rule applying asfix-yield is no
	longer required becayse pack-sdf now outputs SDF concrete syntax
	by default.

	Note that tools must use the new Makefile.xt. Bootstrapped source
	distributions that include Makefile.xt will only install because
	the .defs are already included. If this file is removed the
	package will also need the updated Makefile.xt.
	
2003-11-16  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* autoxt.m4: configuration switch for concrete-syntax package

2003-09-30  Akim Demaille  <akim@lrde.epita.fr>

	* autoxt.m4: Set #serial to 2.
	(USE_XT_PACKAGES): Quote M4 arguments.
	Don't overquote shell assignments.
	Wrap to fit into 80 columns.

2003-09-24  Merijn de Jonge  <m.de.jonge@tue.nl>
        * Makefile.xt: changed from single to double colon style in targets
          install-data-local and install-exec-local

2003-08-25  Martin Bravenboer  <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

	* Makefile.xt: removed -fc, -typematch, -fold-strategy
    rules. Tools are broken and the rules are causing trouble
    when invoking the reincarnations in stratego-regular.

2003-01-17  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* change BOX_TOOLS to GPP

2003-01-12  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* autoxt.m4: --with-c-tools 

2003-01-04  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* Makefile.xt (install-data-local): import repositories declared with the
	XTC_IMPORT variable and ensure that the directory for the repository exists.

2003-01-02  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* Makefile.xt (bootclean-recursive): make rules supporting recursive
	bootclean target. Define BOOTCLEAN_SUBDIRS for any directory with
	subdirectories that should be bootcleaned.

2002-12-31  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* autoxt.m4 (USE_XT_PACKAGES): template for use in config file

2002-12-21  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* Makefile.xt (sdfdatadir): Install .sdf, .def, and .tbl files as
	sdfdata_DATA

2002-12-16  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* Makefile.xt: Fix for shells that cannot deal with empty variables (Martin)

2002-12-06  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* Autoconf/automake support for packages developed with StrategoXT.
