   * Added --with-sdf-tools configuration switch.
   * Added -d option to asfix2sdf to enable de-normalization of 
	a reconstructed grammar.
   * Added -g option to asfix2sdf to allow an initial grammar to
	be supplied. Instead of reconstructing a new grammar from the
	asfix input, this supplied grammar is minimized on the basis
	of the asfix input.
