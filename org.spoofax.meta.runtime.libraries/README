Stratego libraries for several components used in Spoofax.

== Building ==

The runtime libraries are built to Stratego binary libraries, in rtree, ctree and jar format.
Requirements for building are:

* Ant
* Ant contrib: http://sourceforge.net/projects/ant-contrib/files/ant-contrib/ant-contrib-0.6/
* Java compiler
* Stratego compiler: https://github.com/metaborg/strategoxt/tree/java-bootstrap/strategoxt
* Stratego ant library: https://github.com/metaborg/strategoxt/blob/java-bootstrap/strategoxt/ant-contrib/strategoxt-antlib.xml

The Stratego ant library needs to be copied into this directory.
To build from command line, invoke the ant script `build.xml` with the `eclipse.spoofaximp.strategojar` property set to the strategoxt jar file, which contains the stratego compiler.
To build from Eclipse with Spoofax installed, right click `build.xml`, choose `Run As -> Ant Build`.
