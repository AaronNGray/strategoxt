Currently, there is no source distribution of this project. A checkout from SVN
may be built using the typical Automake process.

First, run 

  ./bootstrap

(if you are not on Gentoo or Debian, you must adjust the env vars to select automake 
 and aclocal manually, see the bootstrap script for a hint).

Apart from Stratego/XT and Java Front, you will need the aterm-1.6.jar. It may be 
found at the CWI build site: http://homepages.cwi.nl/~daybuild/releases/ 

Also, you will need a Java Development Kit (JDK). Once installed, run:

  ./configure --with-aterm-java=<path to aterm-1.6.jar> --with-jdk=<path to a JDK>

After this, you should be good to make and install.
