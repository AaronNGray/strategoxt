STRJ and the Stratego/J runtime have been developed by:

* Lennart Kats (main STRJ development; Stratego/J compatibility components)
* Karl Trygve Kalleberg (main Stratego/J and JSGLR development; original s2j prototype)
* Valentin David (Stratego/J runtime)

The development of STRJ would not have been possible without the
efforts of Eelco Visser and his team in developing the STRC reference
stratego compiler. Martin Bravenboer's Java-Front library and syntax
definition have also been indispensable for the development STRJ.
