---------++ New Dynamic Rule Features

    (Eelco Visser)

---------++ Separate package for StrategoXT utils

    (Rob Vermaas)

---------++ Stratego Compiler

   * Dynamic rules use a more special dummy

	* spec/front/lift-dynamic-rules.str: changed the dummy used in
	dynamic rule keys from [] to DR_DUMMY. This conflicts with dynamic
	rules that contain []. Note, that these rules now also have a
	different key. If you want them to have the same key, then for
	example move the [] pattern to the where condition.

	* spec/front/lift-dynamic-rules-old.str: use your own dummify. The
	dummifies in the old and new lifter where overloaded, leading to
	conflicts.

   * Redefinition of external s

	* spec/front/needed-defs.str: check for external redefinitions
	before removing definitions that are not invoked from the code in
	the program that is currently being compiled. This solves issue
	STR-193.

   * Only Cons/2 and Nil/0 are now reserved.

	* spec/c/s2c.str: fixed STR-201, STR-205 and STR-25 by making some
	checks more precise. The match and build translation strategies
	checked for the string "Cons" and "Nil", where they should
	actually also check the arity of these Ops. The Cons and Nil rules
	where not applicable. Hence, the compilation failed.

   * Improved reporting of ambiguities.

   * Disable heuristic filters in parse-stratego 
     HeuristicFilters(Off)

   * Support for quoted constructors

    (Martin Bravenboer)

---------++ Stratego Standard Library

   * iowrap is obsolete

    (Rob Vermaas)

* spec/pipe.str: bug fixes. 
  - stdin-from-pipe and stdout-to-pipe didn't work correctly when
  Pipe argument was stdin (0) or stdout (1). Since stdin and stdout
  were explicitly closed, the connection with the pipe was lost.
  Using dup2 instead of dup solves the problem because there is no
  need to close file descriptiors.
  -write-term-to-text-pipe uses WriteToTextFile but outfile argument
  is a stream. Replacing WriteToTextFile by fprint solved the
  problem.

    (Merijn de Jonge)

* logging

    (Niels Janssen)

* call(|opt-fdin, opt-fdout, opt-fderr)

    (Martin Bravenboer)

---------++ AutoXT

All macros now use the XT prefix

Use AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR and fix in strc-core Makefile.am

	* autoxt.m4: USE_XT_PACKAGES is obsolete and should be replaced by
	in your configure.ac files by XT_USE_XT_PACKAGES. Thanks to Akim
	for suggesting to use autoupdate macros.

	* autoxt.m4: DETECT_SVN_REVISION was already obsolete, but now
	also used an autoupdate macro.

    (Akim Demaille and Martin Bravenboer)


---------++ ATerm to XML

	* trans/data2xml-doc.str, trans/xml-info2data.str: the --explicit
	and the --very-explicit mode now use the XML namespace
	http://aterm.org for the XML elements the represent ATerm
	structures and types, such as list, tuple, int, string, anno
	etc. In the explicit mode, this avoids conflicts with 'real'
	ATerms of the same name. I'm using the namespace prefix 'at'.

	* trans/data2xml-doc.str, trans/xml-info2data.str: all modes now
	preserve all annotations by representing them as nested "anno"
	elements in the XML namespace http://aterm.org.

	* xtc/xml2aterm.str: the explicity mode is no longer required for
	this tool, since it is no longer ambiguous whether the xml is
	implicit, explicit or very explicit.

    (Martin Bravenboer)

----------++ Separate compilation

liblib split into libstrategolib and libxtclib. The 
module liblib is still available and imports the
libraries above, in order to avoid having to patch
zillions of Stratego modules.

---------++ Misc. Fixes

   * --max-depth flag for pp-aterm (Rob Vermaas)

   * Removed dep on Perl.

gpp:

   * fixed error reporting of ppgen

asfix-tools:

	* src/implode/sglri.str: added the --no-heuristic-filters option
	to disable the heuristic filters of sglr.

stratego-regular:

	* trans/sdf2rtg/core-sdf-grammar2rtg.str: nice names for character
	classes.

   sdf2rtg: Report productions and symbols in concrete syntax. Also,
   added some hints about how to solve problems.

added error reporting of martin to sglri
