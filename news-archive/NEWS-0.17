-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Stratego/XT 0.17 - released April 2008
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

---------++!! Summary of Changes

Stratego/XT 0.17 introduces a major improvements across the board,
including language additions, a new compiler library, numerous
improvements to the compiler, significant changes to the library
handling, new libraries for parsing, pretty printing and term
validation, 64-bit support, stack traces and more.

For this release, over 200 outstanding issues have been addressed,
much thanks to the efforts of external bug reporters and contributors.

The manual has been updated to reflect the changes made to the
language and libraries, and the new libraries come with up-to-date
source code documentation.

---------++ Stratego Compiler

---------+++ Standard C: Dropped GCC's nested functions

The backend has been changed so that the GCC-specific nested functions
feature is no longer required. This makes the C-code a lot more
portable across GCC-supported platforms, since nested functions are
not reliably supported on all architectures, notably not on MIPS and
OSX/Intel. Furthermore, this allows Stratego to use other C compilers
for than GCC for the generation of platform-specific binary code.

   * [<a href="http://bugs.strategoxt.org/browse/STR-119">STR-119</a>] - Replace GCC nested functions by stack-allocated closures as structs

---------+++ Stack traces on "rewriting failed"

The compiler backend and supporting runtime code have been modified to
provide full stack traces for the dreaded "rewriting failed"
situations.

Consider the following program:

<verbatim>
  main = foo

  foo = bar

  bar = fap ; zap

  fap = id

  zap = fail 
</verbatim>

When executed, it will print:

<verbatim>
prog: rewriting failed, trace:
        main_0_0
        foo_0_0
        bar_0_0
        zap_0_0 
</verbatim>

This also works when you use =io-wrap= and friends, but there are some
caveats:

   * Only code compiled with the new compiler will show up in the
     stack trace: if you call old libraries, stack frames for those
     strategies will be invisble.
 
   * =let=-blocks and other reasons for lifting will show up as
     =lifted_X= frames.

A tiny set of stack introspection strategies for debugging purposes
has also been introduced.

---------+++ Compiler library

The compiler has been librarified. Program analysis and transformation
tools which work on Stratego code may now be based on the Stratego
compiler library. The intent is to make meta-programming with Stratego
a lot easier and speedup the Stratego compiler.

---------++ Stratego Language

---------+++ Dynamic rules

---------+++ External Constructor Declarations

---------+++ Assignment operator

An assignment operator has been added to the language as a more
attractive syntax for the common pattern =s => t=. In the assignment
operator, the variable name is now before the right-hand side. Also,
the right-hand side is a term pattern.

<verbatim>
  get-signature(|file) :
    Method(_, returntype, name, types, _, _) -> MethodSignature(cn, returntype, name, types)
    where
      cn := <get-classname> file
</verbatim>

This used to be written as:
<verbatim>
  <get-classname> file => cn
</verbatim>

Note that this is a purely syntactic change: the variable can only be
assigned to once.

   * [<a href="http://bugs.strategoxt.org/browse/STR-550">STR-550</a>] - Assignment operator

---------+++ Rule syntax in let

The =let= construct now allows the defition of rules in addition to strategies:

<verbatim>
  let R : p1 -> p2
  in 
    ...
  end
</verbatim>

---------+++ Import ATerm from file

A new language construct called =import-term= was added which allows
the embedding of terms (data) directly into the program.

<verbatim>
  get-pp-table = import-term(pptable.trm)
</verbatim>

This removes the need for external data files, such as parse and
pretty-print tables. The resulting executable is self-contained, thus
making deployment of your program transformation tools easier.

   * [<a href="http://bugs.strategoxt.org/browse/STR-577">STR-577</a>] - Stratego: support import of an ATerm from a file

---------++ Stratego Libraries

A new discipline for library naming and usage is introduces in
0.17. The standard library is now named =libstratego-lib=, whereas the
XTC library is named =libstratego-xtc=. Additional libraries have been
added for parsing, pretty printing and term validation, see below.

---------+++ Migrating from XTC to libraries

To avoid the term serialization paid when composing transformation
pipelines using XTC, the compiler and all supporting tools have been
rearchitected to as libraries in addition to the familiar XTC
components.

For Stratego/XT users, the most significant change is that the SGLR
parser, the various RTG tools and the GPP tools are now available as
libraries, respectively named =libstratego-sglr=, =libstratego-rtg=
and =libstratego-gpp=.

The librarification allows parse tables to be loaded once, at startup,
and used repeatedly when multiple files must be parsed (when using
XTC, the parse table is loaded by the =sglr= child process every time
a file must be parsed).

Consider the following program:

<verbatim>
module foo
imports
  libstratego-lib
  libstratego-sglr
strategies
  main =
    tbl := <import-term(Exp.tbl); open-parse-table>
    ; <parse-string(|tbl)> "a+b"
</verbatim>

It assumes the existence of a parse table (=Exp.tbl=). This table be
included into the program using the =import-term= construct
(introduced above). The call to =open-parse-table= will register the
parse table with the =libstratego-sglr= library, and subsequent calls
to =parse-string= will not need to reload the parse table.

Compiling and executing the program:

<verbatim>
$ strc -i foo.str $(strcflags stratego-lib stratego-sglr)
$ ./foo 
Plus(Var("a"),Var("b"))
</verbatim>

The resulting program =foo= is now fully self-contained. It does not need
the =Exp.tbl= file to execute.

API documentation for the Stratego Libraries is available from the
Documentation page on the Stratego/XT website.

---------+++ strcflags

The new tool =strcflags= makes it no longer necessary to know all the
details of how to invoke the Stratego compiler when you're using a
certain library. Given the name of a package or Stratego library, the
tool returns the flags (such as include paths) for strc.

Example:
<verbatim>
$ strc -i foo.str $(strcflags stratego-lib)
</verbatim>

You can also specify multiple packages. For example, if you're using
java-front, then you usually using the Stratego library as well.

<verbatim>
$ strc -i foo.str $(strcflags stratego-lib java-front)
</verbatim>

The tool strcflags is a simple wrapper around the tool =pkg-config=,
which we are using for configuring Stratego/XT packages when building
packages from source.

To support strcflags with your own packages, add a declaration of a
variable =strcflags= to the pkg-config =.pc= files.

---------+++ Easy library creation

Creating libraries using the Stratego compiler has never been
easier. By using the =--library= option to the compiler, all necessary
library files will be created.

<verbatim>
$ strc -i foo.str --library
</verbatim>

The resulting output includes static and dynamic libraries, as well as
libtool support files:

<verbatim>
libfoo.a  libfoo.c  libfoo.la  libfoo.lo  libfoo.o  libfoo.rtree  libfoo.so 
</verbatim>

This option is intended for creating libraries that are not part of an
autoconf/automake package, similar to invoking =strc= to compile a
program all the way to an executable.

---------++ Deployment

This release brings about major improvements to the deployment capabilities of 
Stratego/XT. 

---------+++ Standards-compliant libraries

The Stratego libraries expose various features from the underlying
platform Stratego/XT executes on. In 0.17, the library has been
refactored so that the dependence on platforms is clearer, and this
gives rise to several variants of the library, including one for C99,
POSIX and one for POSIX+XSI. The great majority of Stratego/XT
programs, use the high-level strategies for file and term I/O, and
these programs will be unaffected.

The main benefit of this change is that we can now build all the
Stratego libraries on platforms that only support functions from
standard C99 (i.e. not full POSIX). This enables the deployment of
Stratego applications on such platforms. Some strategies from the
Stratego library are only available in the POSIX and POSIX+XSI
extensions. The name of the modules defining these strategies reflect
this.

   * [STR-613] - Stratego library: Allow creation of library for specific standard (C99, POSIX, POSIX XSI)

---------+++ Native Windows Support (MinGW)

Stratego/XT now supports compiling natively on Microsoft Windows using
MinGW.  This results in a smaller footprint because of significantly
fewer and smaller dependencies as compared with Cygwin.

Binaries created for MinGW can be deployed to Microsoft Windows users
without any dependencies.

For this purpose, the =stratego-libraries= package is also available
separately from Stratego/XT as source tarball and native Microsoft
Windows binaries. If you already have Stratego/XT, then there is no
need to install the =stratego-libraries=.

---------+++ OSX support

Stratego/XT 0.17 now fully supports OSX on <nop>PowerPC as well as Intel CPUs.

---------+++ x86-64 support

Thanks to patches from Eelco Dolstra, the ATerm library now supports
64-bit machines, and the final blocker preventing Stratego/XT running
on 64-bit is now removed. This means 64-bit support is finally
here. Binary packages for 64-bit Linux distributions are provided for
your convenience.
