---------++ Separate Compilation

The basic implementation of sepate compilation of Stratego programs
has been available from [[StrategoRelease094][StrategoXT 0.9.4]], but
the feature has always been experimental. The open issues (mostly
configuration related) have all been resolved in StrategoXT
0.11. Therefore, separate compilation of Stratego is now ready to be
used.

In StrategoXT 0.11 AutoXT has been extended with support for separate
compilation. Therefore, using separate compilation in your AutoXT
based package is really easy. Separate compilation is now also
supported for XTC tools, which drastically reduces the compile time of
such tools. Furthermore, the stand-alone Stratego compiler =strc= now
accepts flags for separate compilation. This is very convenient for
small tests programs, or just for testing separate compilation.

The exact details are explained in an
[[HowToUseSeparateCompilation][how to]] available at the Stratego
website (documentation).

---------++ Cygwin and Mac OS X Support

For StrategoXT 0.10 we announced support for Mac OS X. Unfortunately
this claim was obviously not verified very well, since we soon
received several reports of failures at Mac OS X. For StrategoXT 0.11
we have worked on solving these issues and we are sure that we can now
safely re-announce support for Mac OS X. StrategoXT 0.11 has been
compiled and checked at two different Mac OS X 10.3.4 systems with
Apple's GCC 3.3 (unpatched). Moreover, binary distributions for Mac OS
X are available at the release page.

Various problems had to be fixed at Mac OS X:

   * A very creepy issue with optimizations performed by GCC has been
   fixed in the implementation of some

   * The stand-alone Stratego compiler now passes more standard flags
   to GCC.

   * Various issues with separate compilation at Mac OS X have been
   fixed. For example, initializers of dynamic libraries are by
   default invoked in a lazy way at Mac OS X. This issue has been
   fixed in AutoXT by passing a flag to the linker at Darwin systems.

Cygwin support has also been verified. Separate compilation is
currently not supported at Cygwin. As a result, static linking is used
for the separately compiled SSL and executables are rather large. We
hope to fix this issue in a future release. Binary releases for Cygwin
are also available ath the release page.

---------++ Various Deployment Improvements

The deployment of StrategoXT has been improved at several
points. First, the distributions of StrategoXT 0.10 are much
smaller. A source distribution is now about 9 MB, which used to be 14
MB. This has been achieved by (1) not distributing bootstrapped
sources of programs that are only used in a check, (2) not
distributing parse tables, (3) reduction of the size of bootstrapped
sources by heavy use of separate compilation in StrategoXT.

Second, the dependencies of StrategoXT are now finally checked in the
configure script. If the provided configuration is incorrect, then the
configure will fail and explain where the tools were expected in the
current configuration. The configure scripts checks for the ATerm-gcc
library in the aterm package, which is constructed by passing the
--with-gcc flag to the ATerm configure script. It also checks for
several tools that are part of the packages of the sdf2-bundle.

The checks have been implemented as macros (=XT_PKG_ATERM= and
=XT_PKG_SDF=) in AutoXT, so you can use them in your package as
well. The macro =XT_PKG_STRATEGOXT= can be used if you want to verify
in your packages that the provided configuration for StrategoXT is
correct.

---------++ Upgrade of SDF Packages

StrategoXT 0.11 uses a new version of the SDF language and its
implementation. The SDF packages are collected in the sdf2-bundle 2.2,
which is available from the release page of StrategoXT 0.11. 

%RED%Important: %ENDCOLODR% the new version of SDF contains a new
construct for declarating start symbols of the syntax definition. In
older versions of SDF there was no way to declare start
symbols. Instead, all declared sorts were implicitly added as start
symbols. You must add this new explicit declaration of start-symbols
to your syntax definition, otherwise the generated parse table will
not parse anything. For example, if you want =Module= to be a start
symbol of your syntax definition, then you should add a declaration
=context-free start-symbols Module=. You can also declare complex
start symbols. Declaring all sorts (in a =sorts= construct)is now
encouraged, since the parse table generator is then able to do more
static checking of the syntax definition and warn about suspicious
constructs.
