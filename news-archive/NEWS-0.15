StrategoXT 0.15 -- released ...

This is a release of a major milestone in the Stratego Core
refactoring project. It is not considered to be a production release
to be used by average users. Use of the release for testing by
seasoned Stratego developers who maintain applications in the
Stratego/XT environment, would be appreciated, however.

This release will be followed by a number of minor releases,
introducing improvements in the areas of the compiler back-end,
dynamic rules, the module system, and the optimizer. This should
result in a stable and much improved Stratego compiler in release
0.16.

Since the distributions before 0.16 are experimental, distributions
are only provided through the Nix release management system. No
binaries for Windows and MacOSX will be provided.

---------+++ Stratego Core Language

The Stratego Core language project constitutes a major refactoring of
the syntax definition of the language, also requiring a refactoring of
all tools and components processing Stratego programs (in particular
the compiler).

the project was prompted by the problems encountered in building
the first version of the Stratego Optimizer in 2003.

also, language development had collected (*** cruft ***)

that needed cleaning

Thus, the aims of the project are to

(1) Clearly distinguishing a core language to be used as intermediate
language in the compiler.

The syntax definition is now divided into a Stratego-Core language
that is extended to the full language in Stratego-Sugar, adding
syntactic abstractions to the Core. The Core is a strict subset
of the full language.

In addition a number of regular tree grammars is defined that denote a
number of intermediate languages between Stratego-Sugar and
Stratego-Core. These RTGs are used by the compiler to verify the
sanity of the compiler components.

(2) 
integrating term annotations in the abstract syntax of the core
language

(3) Cleaning up the language, removing constructs that had not proven
to be useful, or have been subsumed by more more general constructs.

Despite the changes in the _structure_ of the language, the syntax is
backwards compatible. This entails that existing applications should still
work Except of course for constructs that have been
removed, but these obscure anyway and hardly used in real
applications. A change that may have impact is that old style dynamic
rules are no longer supported.


---------+++ Term Annotions

   t := i | r | x | pt{^pt}

   pt := c(t1,...,tn) | x

Sugar

   t := pt | pt{t1,...,tn}

    pt -> pt{^Nil()}
    pt{t1,...,tn} -> pt{^Cons(t1,...,Cons(tn,Nil()))}


---------+++ List Variables

list variables in concrete syntax

---------+++ Disambiguation

Syntactical ambiguity with higher order arguments

syntax priority issue: 's1 < s2 + s3 + s4' is ambiguous

---------+++ Rules in let

Let: support rule syntax

---------+++ Outdated constructs no longer supported

Old style dynamic rules no longer supported

Remove the following features from the language

- contextual rules
- literate programming comments (\begin{code} ... \end{code})
- strategy rules ( L :: s1 --> s2 )
- thread
- modified congruenc
