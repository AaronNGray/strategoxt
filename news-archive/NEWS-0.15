StrategoXT 0.15 -- released ...

This is a release of a major milestone in the Stratego Core
refactoring project. It is not considered to be a production release
to be used by average users. Use of the release for testing by
seasoned Stratego developers who maintain applications in the
Stratego/XT environment, would be appreciated, however.

This release will be followed by a number of minor releases,
introducing improvements in the areas of the compiler back-end,
dynamic rules, the module system, and the optimizer. This should
result in a stable and much improved Stratego compiler in release
0.16.

Since the distributions before 0.16 are experimental, distributions
are only provided through the Nix release management system. No
binaries for Windows and MacOSX will be provided.

---------++ Stratego Language

(Issues STR-58, STR-306, STR-321, STR-316, STR-319, STR-322, STR-235



---------+++ Stratego Core Language

The Stratego Core language project aims at 

clearly distinguishing a core language to be used as intermediate
language in the compiler

integrating term annotations in the abstract syntax of the core
language

cleaning up the language



---------+++ Term Annotions

   t := i | r | x | pt{^pt}

   pt := c(t1,...,tn) | x

Sugar

   t := pt | pt{t1,...,tn}

    pt -> pt{^Nil()}
    pt{t1,...,tn} -> pt{^Cons(t1,...,Cons(tn,Nil()))}


---------+++ List Variables


list variables in concrete syntax

---------+++ Old style dynamic rules no longer supported

---------+++ remove obscure features

 Remove the following features from the language
- contextual rules
- literate programming comments (\begin{code} ... \end{code})
- strategy rules ( L :: s1 --> s2 )
- thread
- modified congruenc

---------+++ Syntactical ambiguity with higher order arguments

---------+++ Let: support rule syntax

---------+++ syntax priority issue: 's1 < s2 + s3 + s4' is ambiguous




---------++ Stratego Core Compiler

---------+++ strc

---------+++ Option for preferring .str files over .rtree files





---------++ StrategoXT Deployment and Build System

---------+++ Build order of stratego-front and stratego-lib

---------++ Stratego Library

collect-all: recurse to current term instead of children of current term STR-264
