StrategoXT 0.15 -- released ...

This is a release of a major milestone in the Stratego Core
refactoring project. It is not considered to be a production release
to be used by average users. Use of the release for testing by
seasoned Stratego developers who maintain applications in the
Stratego/XT environment, would be appreciated, however.

This release will be followed by a number of minor releases,
introducing improvements in the areas of the compiler back-end,
dynamic rules, the module system, and the optimizer. This should
result in a stable and much improved Stratego compiler in release
0.16.

Since the distributions before 0.16 are experimental, distributions
are only provided through the Nix release management system. No
binaries for Windows and MacOSX will be provided.

The Stratego Core language project aims at 

clearly distinguishing a core language to be used as intermediate
language in the compiler

integrating term annotations in the abstract syntax of the core
language



---------+++ Term Annotions

   t := i | r | x | pt{^pt}

   pt := c(t1,...,tn) | x

Sugar

   t := pt | pt{t1,...,tn}

    pt -> pt{^Nil()}
    pt{t1,...,tn} -> pt{^Cons(t1,...,Cons(tn,Nil()))}
