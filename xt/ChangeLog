	* www/: Made the content bar prettier and added a counter.

	* collect.sh: Added support for checking out development packages
 	such that one can work on one of the packages in XT and commit
 	changes via cvs. (It might be necessary to clean this up. I did it
 	using the mechanism currently installed, but it could be done more
 	directly by immediately checking out the directory in the main
 	directory.)

	* dev-pkg-list: A configuration in which stratego, gb, and gt are
 	developer directories.
