        * bug fix. Build process now teminates when building one of its sub
          components fails

2000-06-21  XT Tester  <xtest@node11794.a2000.nl>

	* collect.sh: Moving ${pkg} to ${pkg}-${version} such that a
	directory ${pkg}-${version} is made in the main directory in the
	case of cvsdev; for consistency

2000-04-17 <mdejonge@cwi.nl>
        * added --with-aterm=${prefix} to configuration of asfix library
2000-04-13 <mdejonge@cwi.nl>
        * released version 0.2
        * increased version number (0.3)
        * fixed unpacking of distributions: tar zxf is gnu tar specific!

2000-04-12    <visser@loempia.cs.uu.nl>

	* www/: Made the content bar prettier and added a counter.

	* collect.sh: Added support for checking out development packages
 	such that one can work on one of the packages in XT and commit
 	changes via cvs. (It might be necessary to clean this up. I did it
 	using the mechanism currently installed, but it could be done more
 	directly by immediately checking out the directory in the main
 	directory.)

	* dev-pkg-list: A configuration in which stratego, gb, and gt are
 	developer directories.

2000-04-12    <mdejonge@cwi.nl>

          belongs to the aterm library.
        * NEWS file updated
        * increased version number to 0.2 (this should have been done a long  
          ago, after releasing version 0.1)

        * Introduced a dummy subdirectory to get around a bug in automake.
        * fixed install, clean, and check targets
