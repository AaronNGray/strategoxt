Separating Patterns from Failure


INTRODUCTION

- pattern match failure is not explicit
- no separation of concerns between rules and strategies

APPLICATION

- transformation

- primitives of data traversal: all, one
- define using pattern matching
- generic traversals
- renaming, substitution, free-vars

- views
- pattern guards
- transformational patterns

SEMANTICS

- axioms 
- evaluation strategy (lazy/strict)
- confluence
- termination

TYPE SYSTEM

- type checking
- interesting: typing of <+

- see work of Peter Mosses (BRICS, Arhus, Denmark) Action Semantics

COMPILATION

- optimization
- inlining
- pattern fusion


CONCLUSIONS

- fusion: undoing separation to achieve efficiency
