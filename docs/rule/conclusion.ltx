We have discussed two features that seem to be useful to strategic
programming in a functional language.  First, there is the proposed
mechanism to handle pattern match failure, which has the additional
advantage of making some proposed extensions to pattern matching
redundant.  Second, generic traversals are important, but it is not
currently clear how these can be implemented elegantly.
