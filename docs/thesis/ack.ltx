I would like to thank my supervisor Eelco Visser for the many
interesting conversations we had during the course of this project,
and for reading and commenting upon this thesis.  I would also like to
thank Arthur Baars for pointing out that pattern match failure in the
\code{do}-notation will result in the monad's \code{fail}-method being
called (chapter \ref{ch:haskell}).  Finally, I am grateful to Paul
Harrenstein who provided the \LaTeX{} environment for typesetting
natural deduction proofs.
