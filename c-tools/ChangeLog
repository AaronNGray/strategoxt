	* sig/Makefile.am: generate signature with sdf2rtg | rtg2sig.

	* syn/C-Keywords.sdf: keyword productions must be lexical,
	otherwise the Keyword -> Id {reject}, which is lexical, doesn't
	work. This solves the bug that C keywords can be parsed as
	identifiers.

	* tests/*.testsuite: added keyword tests and use concrete syntax
	for parse-unit testsuites.

	* Makefile.am: added line: ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I . such that
	autoreconf can find autoxt.m4
