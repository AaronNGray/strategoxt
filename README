Description
===========

Autobundle is an utility for making software distributions by bundling
multiple (third-party) software packages. Autobundle promotes the
development of reusable components which can be distributed separately, or as
part of larger software systems. Autobundle thus allows you to easily
distribute your software as self-contained packages (by bundling all
required components). This greatly simplifies the installation process of
your software because a user does not need to obtain, configure, and install
these required software packages first.

Two typical applications of autobundle are:
1) The distribution of the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment
   (www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv), which bundles amongst others the ToolBus
   software application architecture, the ATerms abstract data type and
   libraries, a parser, and a parser generator. All these components are
   also distributed and used separately.
2) XT, which stands for `Program Transformations Tools'
   (www.program-transformation.org/xt). It bundles some of the components of
   the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment (the ATerms abstract data type, the parser,
   and parser generator), but in addition the programming language Stratego
   (www.stratego-language.org), a pretty-printer (www.cwi.nl/~mdejonge/gpp),
   the grammar tools (GT) package (www.program-transformation.org/gt), and
   the grammar bases (GB) package (www.program-transformation.org/gb).

Autobundle allows you to easily define such distributions by listing the
components, together with a version number, and the location where the
components can be retrieved. A typical autobundle distribution is thus
simply a collection of components of a particular version.

The autobundle software helps creating an initial framework for the package
and creates the software bundle for you, by downloading the different
components and building a single distribution from them. Autobundle
requires that the components are constructed using autoconf
(www.gnu.org/software/autoconf) and automake
(www.gnu.org/software/automake). The use of autoconf and automake is clearly
described in the documentation of both packages and not addressed here.

Installation
============

1) Getting the software

The autobundle package is open source and distributed as a gzipped tar file
named `autobundle-<version>.tar.gz', where <version> denotes the version of
the package. You can download the package at:

   http://www.cwi.nl/~mdejonge/downloads/

or at the online package base:
   http://www.program-transformation.org/package-base/

After downloading the autobundle package, you can unpack the package as
follows:

> gunzip -c autobundle-<version>.tar.gz | tar xvf -

2) Building and Installing

Then the package needs to be configured:

> cd autobundle-<version>
> ./configure --prefix=<installation_prefix>

Where <installation_prefix> denotes the location where the autobundle
software should be installed (e.g. /opt).

Then you can build and install the package:

> gmake
> gmake install
